# nodejslab
Contains all the files of my project except the node_modules folder.
The results of this lab was a success.
I was able to generate the same outputs as stated in the lab document not only at the end, but at along each step of the way.
This lab was interesting to me because I do not consider front-end programming my expertise,
so there were times where it was difficult for me to debug my errors because I didn't know where to look to even begin debugging.
I also had to download and install Notepad++, since I didn't have any IDEs that could handle saving files in .js or .html.
That being said, I learned a lot during this lab and was able to troubleshoot by simply thinking harder about the error messages I was being shown.
